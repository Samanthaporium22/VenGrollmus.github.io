        <!-- Interest in IT -->
        <section>
            <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
            <h3>What is your interest in IT?  When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>

            <p>My current interest in Information Technology is around programming, developing apps and websites.  The programming languages that I have used are Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, Objective-C and .Net.  I am more comfortable utilising VB and VBA as I have been using this technology for over 30 years.</p>            

            <p>I started programming at school back in 1983, yes that long ago, and was in one of the first classes to study computers in Year 12 (HSC).  It has continued since then.  There wasn’t a particular event of person that sparked my interest, I seemed to just fall into roles that needed me to know programming or automation of spreadsheets to be able to produce reports effectively for management.</p>
            
            <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

            <p>When I decided to expand my knowledge and to enhance my skillset to obtain my Bachelor of Information Technology degree, I started researching on the courses available on who were delivering the courses.  I had already decided that I wanted to do the course remotely (or online) as I am self-employed and take care of elderly parents.</p>

            <p>All my research led me to utilise Open University Australia to do my Bachelor of Information Technology, and on applying to do the course; RMIT was the provider of choice for the degree.</p>

            <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

            <p>My expectations for the course in relation to learning is that I would like to expand on my current experience and knowledge.  The old adage of you are never too old to learn something new has kept me always finding ways of learning; utilising various tools from reading books, YouTube, Chat Rooms, using the good old Dr. Google, short courses, online training platforms such as Udemy and recognised training facilities such as RMIT.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>

This role is to develop, design and maintain the in-house application for Cash Converters, utilising various tools and databases.  The role itself appealed to me, as I enjoy programming and developing and maintaining applications that are used by multiple people, whether it is for internal clients of a business or for a business’s external customer base.
Cash Converters require someone with a minimum of 3 years software development experience, and skills with .Net, SQL, C++, VB, JAVA, XML, ASP, COM/DCOM, SB+ and one of the major relational database packages.  They also require someone that understands open-source programming, and the ability to understand the needs of users and being able to deliver those needs in exceptionally designed programs.
3.3	Skills I Have
With my 30 years’ experience in application development and maintenance, I have developed several applications using VB, .NET and SQL as well as knowledge of SQL Server.  I have also been able to engage with users to determine their needs and to deliver the applications that meets those needs. 
3.4	Skills I Need / Learning Plan
Transposing my knowledge of application developing with the tools of C++, JAVA, XML, ASP, COM/DCOM and SB+ is straight forward; as I have been able to research, read and pick up short courses to improve my knowledge and experience and to be able to increase my value as an employee for a company that chooses to employ me.

4.3	Big 5 Personality Test
The Big 5 Personality Test that I undertook is located at bigfive-test.com.
4.3.1	Neuroticism
Score - 92 (High)
Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.
4.3.2	Anxiety
Score - 14 - high
The "fight-or-flight" system of the brain of anxious individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen. They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful. They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally calm and fearless.
4.3.3	Anger
Score - 15 - high
Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when things do not go their way. They are sensitive about being treated fairly and feel resentful and bitter when they feel they are being cheated. This scale measures the tendency to feel angry; whether or not the person expresses annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's level on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily.
4.3.4	Depression
Score - 10 - low
This scale measures the tendency to feel sad, dejected, and discouraged. High scorers lack energy and have difficulty initiating activities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings.
4.3.5	Self-Conscious
Score - 18 - high
Self-conscious individuals are sensitive about what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and ridicule causes them to feel shy and uncomfortable around others. They are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others will criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but their awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling prophecy. Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel nervous in social situations.
4.3.6	Immoderation
Score - 20 - high
Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and urges that they have difficulty resisting. They tend to be oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long- term consequences.

4.3.10	Gregariousness
Score - 4 - low
Gregarious people find the company of others pleasantly stimulating and rewarding. They enjoy the excitement of crowds. Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by, and therefore actively avoid, large crowds. They do not necessarily dislike being with people sometimes, but their need for privacy and time to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score high on this scale.

4.3.14	Cheerfulness
Score - 12 - neutral
This scale measures positive mood and feelings, not negative emotions (which are a part of the Neuroticism domain). Persons who score high on this scale typically experience a range of positive feelings, including happiness, enthusiasm, optimism, and joy. Low scorers are not as prone to such energetic, high spirits.
4.3.15	Openness To Experience

Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either people or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a waste of time. Intellect should not be equated with intelligence. Intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although high scorers on Intellect score slightly higher than low-Intellect individuals on standardized intelligence tests.
4.3.21	Liberalism
Score - 10 - low
Psychological liberalism refers to a readiness to challenge authority, convention, and traditional values. In its most extreme form, psychological liberalism can even represent outright hostility toward rules, sympathy for lawbreakers, and love of ambiguity, chaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and stability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism and conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly incline individuals toward certain political parties.

Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward high scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low scorers on this scale. It should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly reveal the whole truth.
4.3.25	Altruism
Score - 14 - high
Altruistic people find helping other people genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to assist those who are in need.

4.3.26	Cooperation
Score - 17 - high

4.3.27	Modesty
Score - 17 - high
High scorers on this scale do not like to claim that they are better than other people. In some cases this attitude may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless, some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly. Those who are willing to describe themselves as superior tend to be seen as disagreeably arrogant by other people.
4.3.28	Sympathy
Score - 14 - high
People who score high on this scale are tender-hearted and compassionate. They feel the pain of others vicariously and are easily moved to pity. Low scorers are not affected strongly by human suffering. They pride themselves on making objective judgments based on reason.

4.3.31	Orderliness
Score - 9 - low
Persons with high scores on orderliness are well-organized. They like to live according to routines and schedules. They keep lists and make plans. Low scorers tend to be disorganized and scattered.
4.3.32	Dutifulness
Score - 15 - high

4.3.33	Achievement-Striving
Score - 17 - high
Individuals who score high on this scale strive hard to achieve excellence. Their drive to be recognized as successful keeps them on track toward their lofty goals. They often have a strong sense of direction in life, but extremely high scores may be too single-minded and obsessed with their work. Low scorers are content to get by with a minimal amount of work and might be seen by others as lazy.
4.3.34	Self-Discipline
Score - 13 - high
Self-discipline-what many people call will-power-refers to the ability to persist at difficult or unpleasant tasks until they are completed. People who possess high self-discipline are able to overcome reluctance to begin tasks and stay on track despite distractions. Those with low self-discipline procrastinate and show poor follow-through, often failing to complete tasks-even tasks they want very much to complete.
4.3.35	Cautiousness
Score - 12 - neutral
Cautiousness describes the disposition to think through possibilities before acting. High scorers on the Cautiousness scale take their time when making decisions.

4.4	Review of the 3 Tests
4.4.1	What do the results of these tests mean for you? 
The results of the tests give me an insight into my personality and how this impacts the I work.  I have done tests like this before, and the results between have changed somewhat.  This I believe is due to the fact, that as people, we change and grow over time.  Life experiences can also affect how we feel and answer questions, and the time of day may also impact our answers.
4.4.2	How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? 
I will need to keep in mind that I am part of a group and need to be able to contribute to the group rather than go on tangents doing my own thing.  I will also need to ensure that I speak up with ideas and ensure that I do not take comments as criticisms.
4.4.3	How should you take this into account when forming a team? 
When forming a team; I need to consider how I interact with people, and how they interact with others.  We should have compatible personalities so that we can work effectively together, and ensure that we have someone that is able to Project Manage the team, without actually riding roughshod over the team.
        </section> <!-- End Personality Profile -->
              
       <!-- Project Idea -->
       <section>
            <h2>Project Idea</h2>

5.1	Overview
The project is to develop a mobile Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application which will synchronise with a desktop/web application.  This will allow the sales and technical team maintain customer and supplier details while on the road interacting with the customers and suppliers.  The technical team may also have jobs in the field that they need update records on; and rather than keeping paperwork and notes, and then entering this information into the system when they return to the office, the application will provide this.  This will then free up time for the team, allowing them to focus on billable work and thus increasing revenue for the business.
5.2	Motivation
Working in a small business, where funds are extremely tight, the majority of CRM’s available that are useful for them are not free, and have a monthly fee attached to them.  The aim of this application is that it will be a pay once, and they own the application.  It will be their responsibility to host the application on their own desktop/webserver to ensure that the data is synchronised.  Utilising Visual Studio, a solution will be easily developed to solve a problem for small businesses to maintain a CRM.
5.3	Description
The application will allow the user to do the following: -
Create, update, and delete Customer or Supplier details.
Manage notes.
Send Emails.
Manage Invoices.
Manage Purchase Orders.
The users will be able to track all touch points with the clients or suppliers, tracking of orders that the clients place as well as orders that they place with their suppliers.  The application will also track projects that the client engages the user, so that the user can track estimated effort for the project against the actual effort, as well as the estimated revenue against actual revenue.  This can also be applied against suppliers when they are engaged by the user to provide support / services for a project.
All this information will provide the user with details as to who their best and worst performing suppliers are in relation to providing services and products compared to each other.  The user will also be able to see who their most valuable clients are, in relation to revenue and touch points against those that may be high maintenance and low profitable.
5.4	Tools and Technologies
The tools, technologies, and hardware that this project will need will be Visual Studio to enable the coding of the Mobile Application, Website and interfaces between the mobile application and the website.  GitHub will be used as the source control tool to ensure that the code is in a centralised repository for the team.  The main communication tool will be Microsoft Teams for us to hold regular meetings, which we can also use to record the meetings as well.  Microsoft Word will be utilised to document the meeting minutes and discussions.  Trello can be used to ensure that we understand where we are with our tasks and deliverables.
5.5	Skills Required
The skills for this project at a minimum would be a basic understanding of HTML, Database Interaction, App Development, and the ability to create API interaction between a mobile app and a website.  The tools needed will be Visual Studio for the coding, and access to GitHub for source control.  I feel with the current people undertaking the course, we will be able to find team members to cover the skills needed.  This will ensure that those that may lack some of the skills will be able to improve their skill set, as well as imparting their knowledge to others. 
5.6	Outcome
A successful outcome of the project will allow users to have access to their customer and supplier details while on the road and be able to update customer and supplier details and information surrounding the details.  This will then remove the need for the user to makes notes using pen and paper and have the details accessible to staff who are back in the office.  The development of this project could be impacted by the ability of the various team members to access a centralised database to communicate with, and this will need to be considered.
