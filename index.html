            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>I was born in Sydney and have what they call a heinz variety background.  My father is German, and on my mum&apos;s father side of the family is Chinese and Aboriginal.  On mum&apos;s mum side of the family we go back to England.</p>
            <p>I started working at Woolies back in the day where price guns were still being used and it was my job to do the weekly specials each Saturday, and price the stock.  During this time, I also was in the Army Reserves in Victoria as an Engineer (Sapper) with the 7th Field Engineer Regiment.</p>

        <!-- Interest in IT -->
        <section>
            <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
            <h3>What is your interest in IT?  When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>

            <p>My current interest in Information Technology is around programming, developing apps and websites.  The programming languages that I have used are Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, Objective-C and .Net.  I am more comfortable utilising VB and VBA as I have been using this technology for over 30 years.</p>            

            <p>I started programming at school back in 1983, yes that long ago, and was in one of the first classes to study computers in Year 12 (HSC).  It has continued since then.  There wasn’t a particular event of person that sparked my interest, I seemed to just fall into roles that needed me to know programming or automation of spreadsheets to be able to produce reports effectively for management.</p>
            
            <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

            <p>When I decided to expand my knowledge and to enhance my skillset to obtain my Bachelor of Information Technology degree, I started researching on the courses available on who were delivering the courses.  I had already decided that I wanted to do the course remotely (or online) as I am self-employed and take care of elderly parents.</p>

            <p>All my research led me to utilise Open University Australia to do my Bachelor of Information Technology, and on applying to do the course; RMIT was the provider of choice for the degree.</p>

            <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

            <p>My expectations for the course in relation to learning is that I would like to expand on my current experience and knowledge.  The old adage of you are never too old to learn something new has kept me always finding ways of learning; utilising various tools from reading books, YouTube, Chat Rooms, using the good old Dr. Google, short courses, online training platforms such as Udemy and recognised training facilities such as RMIT.</p>

        <!-- Personality Profile -->
        <section>
            <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
            <h3>Myers Briggs</h3>
            <p>My Personality Type is an Adventurer ISFP-T.</p>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <p>The strength of the Adventurer is charming, sensitive to others, imaginative, passionate, curious and artistic.  They are relaxed and warm with a &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo; attitude that naturally makes them likeable and popular.  The Adventurer can easily relate to others&apos; emotions which helps them establish harmony and good will and minimizes conflict.</p>
            
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            
            <p>The Adventurer&apos;s weaknesses are that they are fiercely independent, unpredictable, easily stressed, overly competitive, and fluctuating self-esteem.  Anything that interferes with their freedom of expression creates a sense of oppression, that makes work a challenge.</p>
            
            <h4>Team Composition</h4>

            <p>The team composition for the Adventurer is where they have as much wiggle room as possible to do things the way that they like; and be spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around.  They just want the chance to express those natural qualities and to know that their efforts are appreciated.</p>

            <p>The Big 5 Personality Test that I undertook is located at <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/" target="_blank">bigfive-test.com</a>.</p>
            <img src="images/big5.png" alt="">
            
            <h4>Neuroticism</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 92 (High)</em></p>
            <p>Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.</p>
            
            <img src="images/anxiety.png" alt="Anxiety Image">
            
            <h4>Anxiety</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 14 - high</em></p>
            <p>The &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; system of the brain of anxious individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen. They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful. They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally calm and fearless.</p>
            
            <h4>Anger</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 15 - high</em></p>
            <p>Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when things do not go their way. They are sensitive about being treated fairly and feel resentful and bitter when they feel they are being cheated. This scale measures the tendency to feel angry; whether or not the person expresses annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's level on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily.</p>
            
            <h4>Depression</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 10 - low</em></p>
            <p>This scale measures the tendency to feel sad, dejected, and discouraged. High scorers lack energy and have difficulty initiating activities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings.</p>
            
            <h4>Self-Conscious</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 18 - high</em></p>
            <p>Self-conscious individuals are sensitive about what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and ridicule causes them to feel shy and uncomfortable around others. They are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others will criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but their awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling prophecy. Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel nervous in social situations.</p>
            
            <h4>Immoderation</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 20 - high</em></p>
            <p>Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and urges that they have difficulty resisting. They tend to be oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long- term consequences. Low scorers do not experience strong, irresistible cravings and consequently do not find themselves tempted to overindulge.</p>
            
            <h4>Vulnerability</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 15 - high</em></p>

            <p><em>Score - 52 - low</em></p>

            <h4>Friendliness</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 14 - high</em></p>
            <p>Friendly people genuinely like other people and openly demonstrate positive feelings toward others. They make friends quickly and it is easy for them to form close, intimate relationships. Low scorers on Friendliness are not necessarily cold and hostile, but they do not reach out to others and are perceived as distant and reserved.</p>
            
            <h4>Gregariousness</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 4 - low</em></p>
            <p>Gregarious people find the company of others pleasantly stimulating and rewarding. They enjoy the excitement of crowds. Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by, and therefore actively avoid, large crowds. They do not necessarily dislike being with people sometimes, but their need for privacy and time to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score high on this scale.</p>

            <h4>Assertiveness</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 9 - low</em></p>
            <p>High scorers Assertiveness like to speak out, take charge, and direct the activities of others. They tend to be leaders in groups. Low scorers tend not to talk much and let others control the activities of groups.</p>

            <p>Active individuals lead fast-paced, busy lives. They move about quickly, energetically, and vigorously, and they are involved in many activities. People who score low on this scale follow a slower and more leisurely, relaxed pace.</p>

            <h4>4.3.13	Excitement-Seeking</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 6 - low</em></p>
            <p>High scorers on this scale are easily bored without high levels of stimulation. They love bright lights and hustle and bustle. They are likely to take risks and seek thrills. Low scorers are overwhelmed by noise and commotion and are averse to thrill-seeking.</p>

            <h4>Cheerfulness</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 12 - neutral</em></p>
            <p>This scale measures positive mood and feelings, not negative emotions (which are a part of the Neuroticism domain). Persons who score high on this scale typically experience a range of positive feelings, including happiness, enthusiasm, optimism, and joy. Low scorers are not as prone to such energetic, high spirits.</p>
            
            <h4>Openness To Experience</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 68 - low</em></p>
            <p>Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.</p>
            
            <img src="images/imagination.png" alt="Imagination Image">
            <h4>Imagination</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 17 - high</em></p>
            <p>To imaginative individuals, the real world is often too plain and ordinary. High scorers on this scale use fantasy as a way of creating a richer, more interesting world. Low scorers are on this scale are more oriented to facts than fantasy.</p>
            
            <h4>Artistic Interests</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 10 - low</em></p>
            <p>High scorers on this scale love beauty, both in art and in nature. They become easily involved and absorbed in artistic and natural events. They are not necessarily artistically trained nor talented, although many will be. The defining features of this scale are interest in, and appreciation of natural and artificial beauty. Low scorers lack aesthetic sensitivity and interest in the arts.</p>
            
            <h4>Emotionality</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 10 - low</em></p>

            <h4>Adventurousness</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 6 - low</em></p>
            <p>High scorers on adventurousness are eager to try new activities, travel to foreign lands, and experience different things. They find familiarity and routine boring and will take a new route home just because it is different. Low scorers tend to feel uncomfortable with change and prefer familiar routines.</p>
            
            <h4>Intellect</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 15 - high</em></p>
            <p>Intellect and artistic interests are the two most important, central aspects of openness to experience. High scorers on Intellect love to play with ideas. They are open-minded to new and unusual ideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. They enjoy riddles, puzzles, and brain teasers. Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either people or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a waste of time. Intellect should not be equated with intelligence. Intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although high scorers on Intellect score slightly higher than low-Intellect individuals on standardized intelligence tests.</p>

            <h4>Liberalism</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 10 - low</em></p>
            <p>Psychological liberalism refers to a readiness to challenge authority, convention, and traditional values. In its most extreme form, psychological liberalism can even represent outright hostility toward rules, sympathy for lawbreakers, and love of ambiguity, chaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and stability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism and conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly incline individuals toward certain political parties.</p>
            
            <h4>Agreeableness</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 92 - high</em></p>
            <p>Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.</p>
            
            <img src="images/trust.png" alt="Trust Image">
            <h4>Trust</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 13 - high</em></p>
            <p>A person with high trust assumes that most people are fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust see others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous.</p>
            
            <h4>Morality</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 17 - high</em></p>
            <p>High scorers on this scale see no need for pretence or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore candid, frank, and sincere. Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward high scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low scorers on this scale. It should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly reveal the whole truth.</p>

            <h4>Altruism</h4>
            <p><em>Score - 14 - high</em></p>
            <p>Altruistic people find helping other people genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to assist those who are in need. Altruistic people find that doing things for others is a form of self-fulfilment rather than self-sacrifice. Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like helping those in need. Requests for help feel like an imposition rather than an opportunity for self-fulfilment.</p>

            <h3>Review of the 3 Tests</h3>
            <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h4>
            <p>The results of the tests give me an insight into my personality and how this impacts the I work.  I have done tests like this before, and the results between have changed somewhat.  This I believe is due to the fact, that as people, we change and grow over time.  Life experiences can also affect how we feel and answer questions, and the time of day may also impact our answers.</p>
            
            <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
            <p>I will need to keep in mind that I am part of a group and need to be able to contribute to the group rather than go on tangents doing my own thing.  I will also need to ensure that I speak up with ideas and ensure that I do not take comments as criticisms.</p>
            
            <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
            <p>When forming a team; I need to consider how I interact with people, and how they interact with others.  We should have compatible personalities so that we can work effectively together, and ensure that we have someone that is able to Project Manage the team, without actually riding roughshod over the team.</p>

        <!-- Project Idea -->
        <section>
            <h2>Project Idea</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The project is to develop a mobile Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application which will synchronise with a desktop/web application.  This will allow the sales and technical team maintain customer and supplier details while on the road interacting with the customers and suppliers.  The technical team may also have jobs in the field that they need update records on; and rather than keeping paperwork and notes, and then entering this information into the system when they return to the office, the application will provide this.  This will then free up time for the team, allowing them to focus on billable work and thus increasing revenue for the business.</p>
            
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Working in a small business, where funds are extremely tight, the majority of CRM’s available that are useful for them are not free, and have a monthly fee attached to them.  The aim of this application is that it will be a pay once, and they own the application.  It will be their responsibility to host the application on their own desktop/webserver to ensure that the data is synchronised.  Utilising Visual Studio, a solution will be easily developed to solve a problem for small businesses to maintain a CRM.</p>
            
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The application will allow the user to do the following: -</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Create, update, and delete Customer or Supplier details.</li>
                <li>Manage notes.</li>
                <li>Send Emails.</li>
                <li>Manage Invoices.</li>
                <li>Manage Purchase Orders.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The users will be able to track all touch points with the clients or suppliers, tracking of orders that the clients place as well as orders that they place with their suppliers.  The application will also track projects that the client engages the user, so that the user can track estimated effort for the project against the actual effort, as well as the estimated revenue against actual revenue.  This can also be applied against suppliers when they are engaged by the user to provide support / services for a project.</p>
            
            <p>All this information will provide the user with details as to who their best and worst performing suppliers are in relation to providing services and products compared to each other.  The user will also be able to see who their most valuable clients are, in relation to revenue and touch points against those that may be high maintenance and low profitable.</p>
            
            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>The tools, technologies, and hardware that this project will need will be Visual Studio to enable the coding of the Mobile Application, Website and interfaces between the mobile application and the website.  GitHub will be used as the source control tool to ensure that the code is in a centralised repository for the team.  The main communication tool will be Microsoft Teams for us to hold regular meetings, which we can also use to record the meetings as well.  Microsoft Word will be utilised to document the meeting minutes and discussions.  Trello can be used to ensure that we understand where we are with our tasks and deliverables.</p>
            
            <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>The skills for this project at a minimum would be a basic understanding of HTML, Database Interaction, App Development, and the ability to create API interaction between a mobile app and a website.  The tools needed will be Visual Studio for the coding, and access to GitHub for source control.  I feel with the current people undertaking the course, we will be able to find team members to cover the skills needed.  This will ensure that those that may lack some of the skills will be able to improve their skill set, as well as imparting their knowledge to others. </p>
            
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>A successful outcome of the project will allow users to have access to their customer and supplier details while on the road and be able to update customer and supplier details and information surrounding the details.  This will then remove the need for the user to makes notes using pen and paper and have the details accessible to staff who are back in the office.  The development of this project could be impacted by the ability of the various team members to access a centralised database to communicate with, and this will need to be considered.</p>
